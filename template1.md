#### Question
How did health care spending vary by race and ethnicity groups in the US from 2002 through 2016?

#### Findings  
This exploratory study that included data from 7.3 million health system visits, admissions, or prescriptions found age-standardized per-person spending was significantly greater for White individuals than the all-population mean for ambulatory care; for Black individuals for emergency department and inpatient care; and for American Indian and Alaska Native individuals for emergency department care. Hispanic and Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander individuals had significantly less per-person spending than did the all-population mean for most types of care, and these differences persisted when controlling for underlying health.

#### Meaning  
In the US from 2002 through 2016, there were differences in age-standardized health care spending by race and ethnicity across different types of care.

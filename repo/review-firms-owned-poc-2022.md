### BACKGROUND

This report from Fed Small Business describes data, collected by the Small Business Credit Survey in 2021, on small business employer firms by race/ethnicity; in some cases, data on firms owned by "people of color," representing a group of race/ethnicity categories, is presented against White-owned firms. It highlights the financial and operational challenges that business owners experienced. (Employer firms are defined as *businesses with 1 to 499 employees other than the owners*.)

> &rarr; **A note on data by race/ethnicity:** Data are analyzed using only four categories: <ins>Asian or Pacific Islander</ins> (referenced as “Asian”); <ins>Black or African American</ins> (referenced as “Black”); <ins>Hispanic or Latino</ins> (referenced as “Hispanic”); and <ins>White</ins>. The report excludes data for <ins>Native American</ins> firms because of the small sample.

### SELECT FINDINGS FROM THE REPORT:

&#10148; **Overall, the pandemic has had more negative effects on firms owned by people of color than on white-owned firms, including greater reductions to their revenue and employment.**      

&rarr; *Pctg. of firms reporting revenues lower than 2019 levels by race/ethnicity:*   
&ensp;&ensp; (% of firms <ins>reporting lower revenues</ins> in each racial/ethnic group is...)
  - 79%, Asian-owned    
  - 72% Black-owned   
  - 67%, Hispanic-owned   
  - 59%, White-owned    
 
&#10148; **Asian- and Black-owned firms (39% and 36% of firms, respectively) were more than twice as likely as white-owned firms (17%) to be in *poor* financial condition at the time of the survey.**     

&#10148; **The share of firms *without* debt ranged from 22%&ndash;32% (across all groups).**  

&#10148; **Among firms _with_ debt, Black- and Hispanic-owned firms had the highest share of businesses with &le;$50,000 in debt, while Asian- and White-owned firms had the highest share of businesses with debt \>$50,000.**       

&#10148; **Black-owned firms were the most likely to say credit availability was a concern.**      

&#10148; **Firms owned by people of color were more likely to apply for traditional financing than white-owned firms, but were less likely to receive the funding sought.**     

&#10148; **When seeking loans, lines of credit, and cash advances from banks (large or small) and nonbank lenders, firms owned by people of color were less likely than white-owned firms to be approved for financing.**  

&rarr; Regardless of the type of lender (i.e., small bank, large bank, online lender, finance company), firms owned by people of color (as a group) were less likely to be fully approved than White-owned firms; and rates of denial were higher for firms owned by people of color, compared to White-owned firms, across all types of lenders.

&rarr; *Pctg. of firms approved for full financing by race/ethnicity among types of lenders:*  
&ensp;&ensp; (% of firms <ins>fully approved</ins> in each racial/ethnic group under each type of lender is...)

&rarr; Black- and Hispanic-owned firms (33% and 29%, respectively) were more likely than White- and Asian-owned firms (23% and 20%, respectively) to turn to online lenders.   
  
&#10148; **For firms that did not apply for financing (in the previous year), reasons varied across the groups:**     

&rarr; *Top reasons for not applying for financing by race/ethnicity:*  
&ensp;&ensp; (% of firms in each racial/ethnic group whose primary reason for not applying is...)

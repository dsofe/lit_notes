### Background

This report from Fed Small Business describes data, collected by the Small Business Credit Survey in 2022, on small business employer firms.

> 
> &rarr; **A note on data by race/ethnicity:** Data by race/ethnicity is available but the weights used for analysis is not available; insights on firms owned by people of color will be shared when that 2023 report is released later this year.

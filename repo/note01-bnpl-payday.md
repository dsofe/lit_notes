This piece briefly comments on the differences between "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) and payday lending and their impact on borrowers.   

- Payday lending has historically been used by individuals earning lower incomes who want to pay off standard expenses (utilities, rent, food).  
- BNPL tends to be used by younger individuals across a wide range of incomes who otherwise can pay for their purchases in full.   
- Many payday loan borrowers in the US cannot repay the loan in full and require a rollover loan to make up for the cost of their tardiness.  
- A survey of BNPL users found that one in three respondents admitted tardiness on one or more installments.   
- BNPL providers have lower interest and late fees relative to payday lenders, whose penalties for missed payments encourage debt dependency.  
- Some US states have capped the fees payday lenders can charge (here's a {link to a map with payday lending interest rates by state](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/map-shows-typical-payday-loan-rate-in-each-state.html), published in 2021.)

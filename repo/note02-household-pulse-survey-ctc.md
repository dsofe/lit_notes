**The U.S. Census Bureau's *Household Pulse Survey*: Insights on Child Tax Credit Spending**

Sharing some data from the **Census' *Household Pulse Survey*** via its data tool.

> What is the Household Pulse Survey? 
>
> The 20-minute online survey--which has been conducted every few weeks since April 2020, with results released shortly after every wave of data collection--is intended to capture how the coronavirus pandemic is impacting households across the country from a social and economic perspective. 
>
> The survey questions generally ask about household challenges and spending in various categories—e.g., health, food—over a range between the last 7 days to the last few weeks. 
>
> Data are collected over a 2-3 week period and released publicly shortly thereafter.

> Note: The survey item varied in how it measured CTC spending after March 2022: 

* For the 9 survey waves between July 21, 2022 and February 7, 2022, the indicator captures
**Child Tax Credit Spending** as *the percentage of adults in households that received a Child Tax Credit payment in the last 4 weeks who either mostly spent it or used it to pay down debt.*

* For the 5 survey waves since March 2, 2022, the indicator captures
**Child Tax Credit Spending (Received from 2021 Tax Return)** as *the percentage of adults living in households that received the Child Tax Credit on their 2021 Federal tax return in the last 4 weeks who either mostly spent it or used it to pay down debt.*

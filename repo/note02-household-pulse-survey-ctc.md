## The U.S. Census Bureau's *Household Pulse Survey*: Insights on Child Tax Credit Spending

Here is some background information on the **[Census' *Household Pulse Survey*](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html)**, the companion data tool, and data points on household use of the Child Tax Credit from the data tool.

### The Household Pulse Survey
The 20-minute online survey--which has been conducted every few weeks since April 2020, with results released shortly after every wave of data collection--is intended to capture how the coronavirus pandemic is impacting households across the country from a social and economic perspective. 

> Note: The survey questions generally ask about recent (spanning anywhere from the past 7 days to the past few weeks) household challenges and spending in various categories—-e.g., health, food. Data are collected over a 2-3 week period and released to the public shortly thereafter.

### Data tool indicator: Child Tax Credit Spending

One indicator tracks how households have used their Child Tax Credit. 

> Note: The survey and data tool varied in how they measured CTC spending after March 2022: 

* For the 9 survey waves between July 21, 2022 and February 7, 2022, the indicator captures
**Child Tax Credit Spending** as *the percentage of adults in households that received a Child Tax Credit payment in the last 4 weeks who either mostly spent it or used it to pay down debt.*

* For the 5 survey waves since March 2, 2022, the indicator captures
**Child Tax Credit Spending (Received from 2021 Tax Return)** as *the percentage of adults living in households that received the Child Tax Credit on their 2021 Federal tax return in the last 4 weeks who either mostly spent it or used it to pay down debt.*

#### Data points *(based on the most recent survey data, collected June 29-July 11, 2022)*

Percentage of households that have either mostly *spent* their CTC or used it to *pay down debt* **rather** than *save* it:  
* NYC metro area--**81%**
* U.S.--**77%**

[This link](https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/#/?s_metro=35620&areaSelector=msa&periodSelector=47&measures=CTCUSENEW) takes you to these results for the **NYC metropolitan statistical area** (which includes municipalities in NJ and PA). You can also filter the data for just NY state. 

### Additional survey data

The indicator summarizes the detailed survey responses. The questionnaire, however, collects richer information--such as the categories (e.g., food, clothing, rent, recreational goods) to which households allocated the “Child Tax Credit” portion of their refund payment.

* The questionnaire is [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/technical-documentation/hhp/Phase3-5_Questionnaire_07_20_22_English.pdf); see pages 17-20 for the CTC questions.

* Detailed survey data are [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/hhp/2022/wk47/ctc1_week47.xlsx); note that the data are very experimental and difficult to interpret.

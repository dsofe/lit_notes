## The Fund for the City of New York's *NYC True Co$t of Living* (2023)

### Background

The NYC True Cost of Living (TCL) “defines the amount of income necessary to meet the basic needs of New York City households, differentiated by family type and where they live. The TCL measures income adequacy and is based on the costs of basic needs for working families: housing, child care, food, health care, transportation, and miscellaneous items such as clothing and paper produces, plus taxes and tax credits.” But an “emergency savings amount to cover job loss” is excluded in the measure.

To determine if a household has adequate or inadequate income, a household’s total income is compared to its NYC True Cost of Living (which differs for each household, based on family composition and geographic location).

Basically...

`Adequate income = Household income > NYC TCL`, and 
`Inadequate income = Household income < NYC TCL`

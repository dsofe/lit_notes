The Urban Institute launched its Financial Health and Wealth Dashboard last



For the purposes of the dashboard, Urban Institute has defined financial health as "as people’s ability to manage their daily finances, be resilient to economic shocks, and pursue opportunities for upward mobility."

And the metrics of the dashboard reflect this definition.

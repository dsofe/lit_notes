## Families’ Job Characteristics and Economic Self-Sufficiency: Differences by Income, Race-Ethnicity, and Nativity  

> [Link to journal article](https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/8/5/67)  

### Background

In this examination of economic self-sufficiency, researchers at Brandeis University assess whether parents’ earnings from full-time work are enough to meet a family's basic needs. The study analyzes only families in which the single parent or both parents works full-time year-round. The results include analysis of families by income level, race/ethnicity, and nativity (i.e., immigrant or non-immigrant).

The study's aims are to determine:  
(1) whether up to two adults in a family earn enough to cover a basic family budget; and  
(2) the extent to which employer-provided benefits, health insurance, and pension plans are available to families  

> **Key concepts:**
> 
> * *Economic self-sufficiency*: The ability to cover a basic family budget with labor-market earnings.  
> * A *family budget* consists of basic needs (housing, food, medical care), work (transportation, childcare), and minimal household expenses.
> * *Family budget wage gap*: The additional hourly wages that low-income full-time working families with children need to cover a family budget.
> * *Full-time, year-round* work: 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year.

### Methodological notes

A few qualifications about the analysis to consider as you reflect on the results:

* Sample drawn from Census data: The Current Population Survey's (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC)
* Data represent the period before COVID-19--specifically, 2015-2019.
* Sample sizes in this analysis:
  * **All** working families: **59,225**
  * **Low-income** working families: **23,231**
* Analysis excludes families in which a parent works only part-time or part-year, is unpaid, or is self-employed.
* Self-sufficiency measured against the Census' *Official Poverty Measure* and an estimated family budget from the *Living Wage Calculator* ([see below](#helpful-resources-cited-in-this-article))

### Findings *(as stated in [the press release](https://www.diversitydatakids.org/research-library/research-report/families-job-characteristics-and-economic-self-sufficiency) or [the article)](https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/8/5/67#sec-10)*

Highlighted findings:  

- **Fewer than 25% of low-income families working full time earn enough to cover a family budget.**
- **Over 25% of low-income families earn less than half of what is needed to meet their budget.**
- **More than half of full-time working Black and Hispanic families (52% and 59%, respectively) do not earn enough to meet their basic needs, compared to 25% of White families and 23% of Asian families.** These inequities persist even after controlling for education, occupation and other characteristics.   
- **The median low-income family who works full time and does not earn a family budget needs an additional $11 more per hour, or about $23,500 in yearly earnings, to cover their expenses.** Black and Hispanic low-income families need to earn even more to cover a family budget: about $26,000 and $26,500 in additional annual earnings, respectively, compared to $20,000 for White low-income families.  
- **The median low-income nonimmigrant family needs to earn an additional $10.43 in hourly wages, versus $11.93 for the median low-income immigrant family, to meet their basic needs.** 
- **Low-income Hispanic families have extremely limited access to benefits through their employers.** More than half (52%) do not have health insurance, and more than three-quarters (76%) do not have pensions.   
- **43% of low-income Hispanic families do not earn a family budget nor do they have access to employer benefits. This is nearly twice as high as low-income White families (24%).** 41% of low-income immigrant families also do not earn a family budget or have access to employer benefits.

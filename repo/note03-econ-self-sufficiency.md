### Summary

In this examination of economic self-sufficiency, researchers at Brandeis University assess whether parents’ earnings from full-time work are enough to meet a family's basic needs. 

<br>
  
> **Key concepts**
> 
> * *Economic self-sufficiency*: The ability to cover a basic family budget with labor-market earnings.  
> * A *family budget* consists of basic needs (housing, food, medical care), work (transportation, childcare), and minimal household expenses.
> * *Family budget wage gap*: The additional hourly wages that low-income full-time working families with children need so they can meet a family budget.

<br>

The study's main objectives are to determine:  
(1) whether up to two adults in a family earn enough to cover a basic family budget; and  
(2) the extent to which two employer-provided benefits, health insurance, and pension plans are available to families

### Findings [*(based on the press release)*](https://www.diversitydatakids.org/research-library/research-report/families-job-characteristics-and-economic-self-sufficiency)

The study offers unique insights about the consequences of declining wages and benefits on full-time working families. Among other key findings:  

- **More than half of full-time working Black and Hispanic families (52% and 59%, respectively) do not earn enough to meet their basic needs, compared to 25% of White families and 23% of Asian families.** These inequities persist even after controlling for education, occupation and other characteristics.   
- **The median low-income family who works full time and does not earn a family budget needs an additional $11 more per hour, or about $23,500 in yearly earnings, to reach one.** Black and Hispanic low-income families need to earn even more to cover a family budget: about $26,000 and $26,500 in additional annual earnings, respectively, compared to $20,000 for White low-income families.    
- **Low-income Hispanic families have extremely limited access to benefits through their employers.** More than half (52%) do not have health insurance, and more than three-quarters (76%) do not have pensions.   
- **43% of low-income Hispanic families do not earn a family budget nor do they have access to employer benefits. This is nearly twice as high as low-income White families (24%).** 41% of low-income immigrant families also do not earn a family budget or have access to employer benefits.
